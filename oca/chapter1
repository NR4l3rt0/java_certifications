JAVA CLASS STRUCTURE	
In Java, classes are the main concept to work with, they have members (fields and methods).
- Classes can be thought as a concept with which a representation of the reality can be exposed.
 They can be tangible or intangible, for example: Animal, Dog, Purchase.

- Fields, also known as variables or data, can be considered as properties that the class have.
 They allow objects to show a certain state. Such as: species, numberOfLegs, total.

- Methods are described sometimes as functions or procedures, but there exists a distinction.
 In essence, a function 'does not return anything', a method does. In any case, the main point to keep in mind is that a method
 is a way of doing something.
It's a behaviour that operates over the aforementioned state or it's a group of actions to do.
 For example: run(), eat(), pay().
 
- Object, "is a runtime instance of a class in memory".That means that an object is going to be something that needs resources
 while the program is in executionand they are placed in the heap. 
For that reason, the group of all objects of the program is going to be the state of the program itself.
 An object can be: tiger, peterTheBestDog, currency.
